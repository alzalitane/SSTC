# [Data Analyst: Seven Sages Tea Company]


## Introduction:
In my latest project where I had the opportunity to work with Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC), a growing tea company based in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington. In this project, I tackled the challenge of centralizing and analyzing sales data to provide actionable insights for the company's CFO. By creating a robust data model and a comprehensive Power BI report, my aim was to empower the CFO with the ability to swiftly review sales performance and profitability across all tea beverages offered by SSTC.

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project was to streamline the disparate sales files and product records within SSTC into a cohesive and easily interpretable format. Specifically, I aimed to:

Develop a data model that integrates information from various sources within the company.
Create a Power BI report that enables the CFO to analyze sales performance and profitability of different tea beverages.
Account for currency considerations, given that SSTC operates in both Washington State (USD) and British Columbia (CAD).
Ensure alignment with the company's fiscal calendar to provide accurate insights.

## Source:
The company, though small, is experiencing rapid growth and is in dire need of assistance in organizing its sales data. As the newest member of the team, I was tasked with the critical responsibility of transforming disjointed sales files and product records into actionable insights for the CFO.

The CFO's primary concern revolved around understanding the sales performance and profitability of SSTC's tea beverages beyond their flagship product, Bamboo Grove Tea. With data collected in-house lacking clarity on profitability and considering the company's dual operations in Washington State and British Columbia, there were significant challenges to overcome.

Moreover, SSTC operates on a fiscal calendar, adding another layer of complexity to the data analysis process. Thus, my solution needed to not only centralize and integrate data but also account for currency conversions and align with the company's fiscal calendar to provide accurate and timely insights.

By addressing these challenges head-on and leveraging the principles of data modeling and visualization, I aimed to provide the CFO with a comprehensive toolset to make informed decisions regarding sales strategies and product offerings, ultimately driving the company's growth and success.
